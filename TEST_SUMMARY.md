# Test Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the automated test implementation for the Kahoot Clone project.

## Test Files Created

1. **quiz-flow.spec.ts** - Core quiz functionality (TC001-TC005)
2. **timer.spec.ts** - Timer behavior tests (TC006-TC007)
3. **game-state.spec.ts** - Game state management (TC008-TC009)
4. **ui-ux.spec.ts** - User interface and experience (TC010-TC011)
5. **edge-cases.spec.ts** - Edge case scenarios (TC012-TC013)
6. **data-validation.spec.ts** - Data integrity tests (TC014-TC015)

## Test Data Attributes Added

The following `data-testid` attributes were added to components for reliable test targeting:

- `question-card` - Main question container
- `question-counter` - Current question number display
- `question-text` - Question content
- `answer-option` - Answer choice buttons
- `feedback` - Correct/incorrect feedback message
- `timer` - Timer display
- `score` - Current score display
- `game-over` - Game over screen
- `final-score` - Final score display
- `restart-button` - Play Again button

## How to Run Tests

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. In a separate terminal, run tests: `npm run test`
3. For interactive testing: `npm run test:ui`
4. For debugging: `npm run test:debug`

## Test Coverage

The tests validate all functional requirements from the README:

- ✅ Quiz initialization and start process
- ✅ Answer selection and feedback
- ✅ Score calculation (correct/incorrect answers)
- ✅ Timer countdown and automatic quiz end
- ✅ Question navigation and completion
- ✅ Game restart functionality
- ✅ Responsive design validation
- ✅ Edge case handling (rapid clicks, browser refresh)
- ✅ Data integrity (question format, score accuracy)

## Notes

- Tests assume the development server runs on `http://localhost:5173`
- Visual feedback tests check for CSS classes indicating selected/correct states
- Timer tests include tolerance for timing variations
- All tests include proper cleanup and state reset between runs
